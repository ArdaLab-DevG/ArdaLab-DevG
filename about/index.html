<h2> Pancreas ... Pancreas and Pancreas... </h2>
<p> The pancreas is a vital organ containing hormone-producing cells organized into islets of Langerhans, whose crucial function is to regulate blood glucose levels. 
Improper regulation of blood glucose leads to diabetes mellitus, a disease that affects more than 10% of the U.S. population. 
Further, uncontrolled growth of pancreatic cells leads to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which ranks 4th among cancer-related deaths in the U.S. 
To understand the molecular anomalies that lead to organ dysfunction and disease, it is crucial to define how the information encoded in the human genome is used at the cellular level to establish tissue and organ systems.</p>
